Deterministic Lockstep
	packet needs to be most common inputs first and include un-ack input packets sent after input changed
		round input to ints
			magnitude in ints
			angle rotation in ints
			bool button pressed
	Send inputs instead of each objects postion
	Set each games random seed to be the same so simulation stays in sync
	if you send at 60 times per second the result on the other end isnt spaced evenly
		playout delay buffer
	add an extra bit to the end of every packet. Input changed
		ack only on input changed back to server


Overall goal
	Use inputs instead of object positions
	Try to shrink packets as much as possible
	Pack multiple inputs up to a cutoff limit into each frame so there is backup data incase frames drop max of like 2 seconds
		packet = List<frame>{ new frame{ jump, xmove, ymove, crouch, inputChanged } }
	only send full packet on input changed
